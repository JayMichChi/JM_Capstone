    "There are also confounding factors that will effect the results: For instance, absolutely/categorically attributing  fatalities to a weather event may not be completely correct, and may in fact occcur our of coincidence. Additionally, there are extenuating factors that could effect the cost or fatality number. For instance, the responsiveness of the National Guard, or massive federal funding may effect the amount of fatalities, or the extent of damage. \n",
